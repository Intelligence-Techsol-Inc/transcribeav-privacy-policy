	<p>The core feature of the TranscribeAV app is to provide transcription of any given audio or video file. Transcription in different languages requires significant processing power and cannot be done with appropriate accuracy on a mobile device. In order to get a translation the mobile app sends the file to Apple server where the actual transcription process takes place. The process is fully automated, no humans are involved into it.</p>
	<p>At any moment of time, you could immediately remove all your translations as well as the documents from the app and our servers by clicking the <strong>Delete account</strong> in the Settings page.</p>
